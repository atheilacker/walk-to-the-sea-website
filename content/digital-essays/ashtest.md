On the eve of the American Revolution, Boston was a bustling hub of global import and export. Along with the European influence colonists brought with them, Bostonians were influenced in furniture, food, and fashion from other countries and continents around the world. Boston sometimes even provided other countries with unconventional goods, showcasing its remarkable global impact as a trading port. 

While this essay highlights some of the most interesting goods in colonial Boston's economy, the city's influence extended to nearly every corner of the Atlantic world.
